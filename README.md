Repository for code accompanying master's thesis on the topic of quality improvement of scanned images using convolutional neural networks.


The main Keras configuration file is `train_model_keras.py`. We can train our model by setting the training variable `train` to 1, 
or evaluate our model by setting this variable to some other value.
